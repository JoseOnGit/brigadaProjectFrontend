# Project Brigada <!-- omit from toc -->

#### As a store-manager... <!-- omit from toc -->

You can let your part-time employees know that you need some help on your store. Either if it's because of some sudden rush in shopping mall, so you need someone just for 2-3 hours, or it's unexpected sick-leave... You can notificate all part-time employees, even from other stores, that there's a chance to earn some extra money.

#### As a part-time employee... <!-- omit from toc -->

You get notification when store needs some extra help on the field. You get notifications also from other stores, so it might be good oportunity to get some extra shifts if you are interested. Also you can notificate store-managers that you have some extra time and you are free to come to work if someone needs your help.

## Frontend

**React, Typescript, Material UI**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
